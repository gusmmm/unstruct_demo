    "summary": "Table 1 compares baseline characteristics of participants receiving hydrocortisone versus control, across two study subsets. Key variables include shock status, age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities like diabetes and kidney disease, and respiratory support. The hydrocortisone and control groups generally show similar distributions across most demographic and clinical factors. For instance, age, sex, and the prevalence of most comorbidities are comparable between treatment groups within each subset. However, the hydrocortisone group in the first subset had a slightly higher proportion of patients with \"Other\" race/ethnicity (20.2% vs. 34.1% in control). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio and SOFA scores also show minor differences between groups and subsets.",

Across subgroups, the adjusted ORs for hydrocortisone ranged from 1.53 to 1.79, with 95% CrIs generally including 1. The probability of superiority for hydrocortisone was between 9.2% and 15.7%.",

Key metrics include the probability of a >20% reduction in the odds of death, median and mean adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI), and probabilities of superiority and harm. For instance, one stratum shows a median adjusted OR of 1.21 (0.19–8.96) and a 42.3% probability of superiority. Another stratum indicates a median adjusted OR of 1.56 (0.80–3.31) with a 10% probability of superiority and 90% probability of harm.
