    "summary": "This table compares baseline characteristics of participants receiving hydrocortisone versus control, across two study subsets. Key variables include shock status, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and various medical conditions like diabetes and kidney disease. The data also covers respiratory support, SOFA scores, and pathogen isolation. Generally, the groups appear similar in most demographic and clinical characteristics, with minor variations in some categories like \"Other\" race/ethnicity and kidney disease prevalence. For instance, the median age is around 60-63 years across all groups.",

The mean adjusted ORs are similar, with the probability of superiority for hydrocortisone ranging from 9.2% to 15.7%. The probability of harm (defined as >20% reduction in odds) is consistently low across all analyses.",
