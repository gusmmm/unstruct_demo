Specifically, 945 participants were enrolled in the Corticosteroid Domain, randomized into three arms: No Corticosteroid (125), Fixed-Course Hydrocortisone (553), and Another corticosteroid arm (267). After accounting for withdrawals and unavailable outcomes, 122, 521, and 258 participants were included in the final analysis for each respective arm. An additional 3,045 participants were eligible for covariate adjustment.",

    "summary": "This Kaplan-Meier curve displays day 90 survival probability for patients randomized to hydrocortisone or control. The hydrocortisone group, with 535 patients, shows a higher survival probability throughout the 90 days compared to the control group, which started with 122 patients. At day 90, the survival probability for hydrocortisone is approximately 0.86, while for the control group it is around 0.82. The number at risk table confirms the decreasing number of patients in each group over time. This figure illustrates the primary outcome of the study, showing a survival benefit for hydrocortisone.",
