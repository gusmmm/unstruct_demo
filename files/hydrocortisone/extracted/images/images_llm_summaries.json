Of these, 945 were enrolled in the Corticosteroid Domain, randomized into three arms: No Corticosteroid (125 patients), Fixed-Course Hydrocortisone (553 patients), and Another corticosteroid arm (267 patients). After accounting for withdrawals and unavailable outcomes, 122 patients were included in the final analysis for the \"No Corticosteroid\" arm, 521 for \"Fixed-Course Hydrocortisone,\" and 258 for \"Another corticosteroid arm.\" An additional 3,045 patients were eligible for covariate adjustment.",

    "summary": "This Kaplan-Meier curve displays day 90 survival probability for patients randomized to hydrocortisone or control. The hydrocortisone group, with 535 patients, shows a higher survival probability than the control group, which started with 122 patients. At day 90, the survival probability for hydrocortisone is approximately 0.86, while for the control group it is around 0.82. The number at risk table confirms the decreasing number of patients over time in both groups. This figure illustrates the primary outcome of the study, comparing survival between the two treatment arms.",
