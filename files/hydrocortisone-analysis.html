Angus*</p><p>© 2025 The Author(s)</p><h3 class="title-2">Abstract</h3><p>Purpose: To determine whether hydrocortisone improves mortality in severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP).</p><p>Methods: In an international adaptive randomized controlled platform trial testing multiple interventions, adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe CAP were randomized to a 7 day course of intravenous hydro cortisone (50 mg every 6 h) or control (no corticosteroid). The primary end point was 90 day all cause mortality, analyzed iteratively by a Bayesian hierarchical model estimating distinct treatment effects for patients presenting with influenza (Y/N) and shock (Y/N).</p><p>Results: Fixed 7 day course hydrocortisone enrollment was stopped for futility (&lt; 5% probability of &gt; 20% relative improvement). Of 658 patients enrolled, 536 were randomized to hydrocortisone and 122 to control. Vital status at day 90 was missing for 15 patients. Day 90 mortality was 15% (78/521) and 9.8% (12/122) for the hydrocortisone and control groups. The adjusted odds ratio ranged from 1.52 to 1.63 (with all 95% CrI crossing 1), while the probability of &gt; 20% relative reduction of day 90 mortality ranged from 7.1 to 3.3% across influenza and shock strata. Results were consistent in sensitivity and pre specified secondary outcomes.

Possible benefits include amelioration of organ damage secondary to excessive host inflammatory responses via their anti inflammatory properties, or miti gation of septic shock via their effects on the renin angi otensin aldosterone axis [2, 3]. Corticosteroids lowered mortality in patients with severe COVID 19 pneumonia [4], in a recent study of severe CAP [5], and in a post hoc analysis of CAP patients in a larger trial of steroids for septic shock [6]. A recent guideline statement now recommends corticosteroid administration for severe CAP [7]. However, other studies yielded inconsistent results [8 13], corticosteroids carry known side effects, and uncertainty persists regarding the type and dose of corticosteroids and whether treatment should be given</p><p class="uncategorized">broadly or to particular subgroups of patients.</p><p>REMAP CAP is an ongoing international platform trial (NCT02735707) designed to evaluate treatments for patients with severe CAP in pandemic and non pan demic settings [14 23]. The REMAP CAP investigators previously reported that hydrocortisone appeared to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID 19, admin istered either as a fixed dose 1 week course or titrated depending on the presence and duration of shock [18]. REMAP CAP also contains a corticosteroid domain for non COVID 19 pneumonia, where patients were ran domized to one of several corticosteroid strategies or control. On December 6th, 2023, the platform ceased randomization to one of the corticosteroid strategies, fixed duration hydrocortisone, on the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) after that arm triggered a pre specified stopping rule for futil ity compared to control (no corticosteroid). Data were locked after the last patient completed follow up for the</p><p class="uncategorized">primary end point and the results are presented here.</p><h3 class="title-2">Methods</h3><h3 class="title-2">Study design and oversight</h3><p>The design of REMAP CAP was reported previously [24, 25]. Patients eligible for the platform are assessed for eli gibility to be randomized to interventions within one or more domains. We report here on patients randomized in the non pandemic corticosteroid domain to fixed</p><p class="uncategorized">duration hydrocortisone or control.</p><p>The trial is managed by a blinded International Trial Steering Committee (ITSC) and an unblinded independ ent DSMB. The trial had multiple international funders and sponsors. The funders had no role in study design, analysis, or reporting. The trial protocol was approved by relevant research ethics committees in each jurisdiction.</p><p class="uncategorized">Informed consent was obtained before randomization</p><h3 class="title-2">Take‑home message</h3><p>In a large international platform trial evaluating multiple interven tions for patients hospitalized with severe pneumonia, we found that, for adults admitted to the ICU with CAP and either cardiovas cular or respiratory failure, the addition of a 7 day course of hydro cortisone to usual care was unlikely to reduce mortality.</p><p>from all patients or their surrogates, or in a deferred fash ion, in accordance with local legislation. The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Hel sinki. All authors vouch for these data and analyses, as well as for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan. There are no confidentiality agreements that preclude the investigators publishing the</p><p class="uncategorized">findings.</p><h3 class="title-2">Participants</h3><p>Adult patients ≥ 18 years, who presented with CAP and were admitted within 48 h of hospital presentation to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory or cardiovas cular organ support, were eligible for enrollment in the platform. CAP was defined as signs and symptoms con sistent with lower respiratory tract infection and radio logical evidence of new onset infiltrate of infective origin [26]. Respiratory organ support was defined as invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation or high flow nasal cannula if flow rate ≥ 30 L/min and FiO2 ≥ 0.4. Cardio vascular organ support was defined as the intravenous infusion of any vasopressor or inotrope. Exclusion cri teria included residents of a nursing home or long term care facility, patients known to have been an inpatient in any healthcare facility within the last 30 days, presump tion that death was imminent with lack of commitment to full support, and participation in REMAP CAP in the prior 90 days. Additional exclusion criteria for the non pandemic corticosteroid domain included a diagnosis of known or presumed COVID 19 infection, known hyper sensitivity to corticosteroids, chronic systemic corticos teroid use, and a lapse of &gt; 24 h since ICU admission. Further eligibility details are provided in the electronic supplementary material. The non pandemic corticoster oid domain was recently extended to allow children and patients with moderate CAP (hospitalization without requirement for organ support). However, no children had been enrolled during the study period reported here and patients with moderate state CAP were ineligible for fixed duration hydrocortisone.</p><p>Achieving a racially and ethnically diverse and sex balanced sample was a goal of REMAP CAP because of evidence of disparities in outcome and treatment effec</p><p class="uncategorized">tiveness in pandemic and non pandemic CAP [27, 28].</p><hr class="pagebreak" /><p>Participants (or their surrogates) self reported their race/ethnicity and birth assigned sex via fixed categories</p><p class="uncategorized">appropriate to their region.</p><h3 class="title-2">Treatment allocation</h3><p>The non pandemic corticosteroid domain compares several interventions, including fixed duration hydro cortisone, shock dependent hydrocortisone (where hydrocortisone is only administered while the patient is receiving vasopressor therapy), fixed duration dexameth asone, and control (no corticosteroid). Only the 7 day fixed duration hydrocortisone arm met stopping criteria, and therefore this report only compares patients rand omized to that arm or to control; other arms are ongo ing and their results remain blinded. Sites participated in this domain if their investigators and clinicians were prepared, based on local equipoise, to randomize to ≥ 2 arms. If sites routinely gave corticosteroids for severe CAP, they could decline participation in the control arm, but still randomize to the different corticosteroid arms. This report therefore includes analysis of an additional subset of patients, those randomized within sites offering both fixed dose hydrocortisone and control. Participants were randomized to each locally available arm, beginning with balanced assignment. Response adaptive randomi zation was applied in a concealed fashion using allocation probabilities derived from each intervention’s probabil ity that it was most favorable, based on the accumulat ing evidence within the platform at each adaptive analysis</p><p class="uncategorized">[24].</p><h3 class="title-2">Procedures</h3><p>Because patients can be randomized to multiple inter ventions, REMAP CAP has primarily used an open label design, avoiding complex multiple placebo regimens. When a patient was randomized to one of the non control arms, the clinical team was provided prescrib ing instructions for the intervention. All corticosteroids were supplied by each site’s pharmacy. Other aspects of care were provided as per each site’s standard of care. Data were collected on baseline characteristics, causa tive pathogens, corticosteroid use, and adverse events and outcomes by site investigators via an interactive web based response technology with validation and logic checks. Although clinical staff were aware of their indi vidual patient’s treatment assignment, neither they nor the ITSC were provided any information about aggre gate patient outcomes until a result was unblinded and</p><p class="uncategorized">released publicly.</p><h3 class="title-2">Interventions</h3><p>Participants randomized to the fixed duration hydrocor tisone arm were prescribed intravenous hydrocortisone bolus of 50 mg every 6 h for 7 days, without tapering. For patients discharged from hospital before the end of the 7 day course, hydrocortisone was discontinued at hos pital discharge. In all patients, systemic corticosteroid therapy was permitted if a new clinical indication devel oped for which corticosteroids are an established treat ment, such as post extubation stridor, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis. In addition to assignment to interventions in the non pandemic corticosteroid domain, participants could be randomly assigned to other interventions within other therapeutic domains [24] (see the electronic sup</p><p class="uncategorized">plementary material and www. remap cap. org).</p><h3 class="title-2">Outcomes</h3><p>The primary outcome was all cause mortality, deter mined 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were: ICU mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and ICU LOS, censored at 90 days; ventilator free days (VFD), organ support free days (OSFD), and proportion of intu bated patients who receive a tracheostomy, censored at 28 days; progression to intubation and mechanical ven tilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or death, and readmission to the index ICU, each during the index hospitalization, censored at 90 days; destina tion at hospital discharge (home, rehabilitation hospital, nursing home or long term care facility, or another acute</p><p class="uncategorized">hospitalization); and serious adverse events.</p><h3 class="title-2">Statistical analysis</h3><p>REMAP CAP uses a Bayesian design with no maximum sample size. Planned adaptive analyses are performed and randomization continues until predefined statistical criteria are met for stopping a domain or intervention arm. The primary analysis of any intervention’s effect is generated from an overarching Bayesian logistic model where the dependent variable is the primary outcome, 90 day mortality. The model is updated as the trial pro gresses, generating updated posterior probability distri butions from the latest trial data and prior distributions, where the initial prior distributions for treatment effects were set as neutral. Full details of the overarching model and statistical analysis plan (SAP) governing the entire platform have been described previously [24]. In keeping with platform rules, following the DSMB’s recommenda tion to cease enrollment into the fixed duration hydro cortisone arm, blinded ITSC members wrote a specific SAP for this comparison of fixed duration hydrocorti</p><p class="uncategorized">sone to control. The plan was posted online (www. remap</p><div class="header">667</div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="header">668</div><p>cap. org) before data lock and analysis (see the electronic</p><p class="uncategorized">supplementary material).</p><p>The primary estimate of the effect of hydrocortisone compared to control was generated from a model that compared the outcome of patients randomized to either hydrocortisone or control within the non pandemic cor ticosteroid domain. The estimate was adjusted for other covariates that affect outcome: location (site, nested within country), age (categorized into 6 groups), sex, time period (3 month epochs), shock (yes/no), influ enza (yes/no), and degree of respiratory compromise and support (not intubated, intubated, and intubated with severe hypoxemia [PEEP ≥ 5cmH20 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 200 mmHg]). As per the overarching design, to estimate the coefficients for these factors as robustly as possible, the primary model used information not only from patients randomized to hydrocortisone or control but rather from all randomized patients who met severe CAP criteria across all domains, regardless of whether patients were included in the corticosteroid domain or not, and inclusive of those patients whose CAP was due to COVID 19 and who were enrolled in domains open to both COVID 19 and non COVID 19 patients. Thus, for example, any effect of ‘site’ could be estimated, and adjusted for, using information from all patients enrolled at that site, and not just those randomized to hydrocorti sone or control. Although not all sites offered both con trol and hydrocortisone, the model’s adjustment for site addressed potential differences in sites that offered one versus both arms.</p><p>Because patients were also being randomized (or not) within other domains and to other interventions, the model also accounted both for each patient’s ran dom assignment to any other intervention in any other domain and for their eligibility for any domain or inter vention (depending on site participation, baseline entry criteria, and patient or surrogate preference). Although the effect of hydrocortisone in patients with COVID was also evaluated in REMAP CAP [18], the current estimate of the effect of hydrocortisone in non pandemic CAP</p><p class="uncategorized">was estimated separately.</p><p>Because the primary model included information about assignment to interventions within domains whose eval uation is ongoing, it was run by the unblinded Statistical Analysis Committee (SAC) (electronic supplementary material), who conduct all protocol specified trial update analyses and report those results to the DSMB. The model was run on all patients enrolled up to December 6th, 2023 for whom complete follow up was ascertained by April 2nd, 2024. Vital status following randomization was determined through medical records, contact with the participant, their next of kin, or other health care pro</p><p class="uncategorized">fessionals. Patients were analyzed according to the group</p><p>to which they were assigned. Those missing the primary end point (n = 15) were ignored; there was no imputation of missing end point values. The primary analysis was expressed as an odds ratio (OR), where an OR &lt; 1 implies benefit. Separate treatment effects of hydrocortisone compared to control were estimated in those with and without vasopressor dependent shock at enrollment and those with and without confirmed or suspected influenza infection. The model used an additive factorial prior with a non informative prior (mean 0, standard deviation 10) on the hydrocortisone main effect and informative pri ors centered on 0 (with standard deviation 0.15) for the additive log odds ratio interaction effects of hydrocor tisone with shock and influenza. This prior structure assumes no knowledge of treatment effect at trial launch and allows separate estimates across influenza and shock strata by shrinking the posterior distributions for the hydrocortisone effects toward the overall effect. In pre trial simulation, these priors performed well across sce narios where treatment effects were either homogenous</p><p class="uncategorized">or heterogenous across equal sized subgroups.</p><p>The model was fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that drew iteratively (20,000 draws) from the joint posterior distribution, allowing calculation of ORs with their 95% credible intervals (CrI). The statistical triggers for an intervention were superiority (&gt; 99% prob ability of OR &lt; 1), futility (&lt; 5% probability of &gt; 20% reduc tion [OR &lt; 1/1.2]), and inferiority (&lt; 0.25% probability</p><p class="uncategorized">that an intervention was optimal in the domain).</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to generate esti mates of the effect of hydrocortisone relative to con trol with full borrowing (pooled estimate across strata) and with no borrowing (independent estimates across strata). Additional sensitivity and secondary analy ses were undertaken using only data from patients in the hydrocortisone and non pandemic corticosteroid domain control groups. These analyses were conducted first on all patients randomized to either of these groups and second restricted to the subset of these patients who were enrolled at sites that offered both options (hydro cortisone or control; see SAP for detail in the electronic supplementary material). This last analysis most closely mimics a traditional 2 arm RCT. Wilcoxon Mann‐Whit ney tests were used to compare the duration of car diovascular support in the hydrocortisone and control groups. Data management and summaries were created using R version 4.1.2, the primary analysis was computed in R version 4.3.3 (2024 02 29), using the rstan package</p><p class="uncategorized">version 2.32.2.</p><hr class="pagebreak" /><figure class="inline"><img loading="lazy" src="extracted/images/hydrocortisone_image_3.jpg" alt="Figure 3"><figcaption>Fig. 1 Screening, randomization, and follow up of participants in the REMAP CAP Corticosteroid Domain Randomized Clinical Trial. #Patients could meet more than one ineligibility criterion. Full details are provided in the supplement. *Currently, there are two primary statistical models for the REMAP CAP platform: the pandemic model (including participants with suspected or proven COVID 19 infection) and the interpandemic model (including participants with non pandemic CAP and with COVID 19 infection who were randomized in domains eligible to both pandemic and non pandemic CAP). +The primary model estimates treatment effects directly from those patients randomized within the corticosteroid domain, comparing the outcomes of those randomized in one arm to the outcomes of those who could have been randomized to that arm, but were in fact randomized to another. However, the model also adjusts for other patient and site characteristics and other intervention effects within other domains that affect outcome. To provide the most reliable and stable estimation of these patient, site, and intervention factors, the model uses data from all patients with non pandemic CAP or with pandemic CAP in domains eligible to both pandemic and non pandemic CAP. ^Contraindications include known hypersensitivity, current treatment with a medicine that cannot be co administered with a corticosteroid, and pregnancy</figcaption></figure><h3 class="title-2">Results</h3><h3 class="title-2">Participant accrual, randomization, and baseline characteristics</h3><p>Between March 11th, 2018, and December 6th, 2023, of 22,568 screened patients, 11,410 met platform enroll ment criteria and were enrolled in REMAP CAP.

Outcome was known for 100% of control patients, 97.2% (521/536) of patients assigned hydrocortisone, and 97.6% (331/339) of patients assigned hydrocortisone at sites where control was also available (Fig. 1). Two factors contribute to the high proportion of patients assigned to fixed duration hydrocortisone. First, one third (n = 197, of whom out come was known for 190 patients) of patients assigned to fixed duration hydrocortisone were randomized at sites that offered &gt; 1 corticosteroid intervention, but not control, due to perceived lack of equipoise. Second, the first adaptive analysis (conducted on 132 patients in the corticosteroid domain with known outcomes, at which point only control and fixed duration hydrocortisone were available in the trial) used a dataset provided to the SAC with a transposition error from the data vendor for some sites, such that 13 and 15 patients in the hydro cortisone and control groups were incorrectly labeled as belonging to the opposite group.

Two stud ies from France both reported benefit. The CAPE COD trial, comparing hydrocortisone to placebo, reported a large reduction in 28 day mortality with hydrocorti sone (absolute difference: 5.6%; 95% CI, − 9.6 to − 1.7) [5]. Patients enrolled in CAPE COD, while slightly older, appeared less severely ill than those enrolled in the cur rent trial in that septic shock was an exclusion criterion and fewer patients were intubated at enrolment. In post hoc analysis of the APROCCHSS trial, which compared hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone to placebo for septic shock, Heming et al. showed a large benefit in the sub group of patients with CAP (OR: 0·60, 95% CI 0.43 0.83) [6]. In contrast, the ESCAPe study, conducted in the US Veterans’ Administration, which compared methylpred nisolone to placebo, reported no difference in 60 day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 1.40),</p><p>[9]. In aggregate, however, a recent meta analysis of 18 studies enrolling over 4000 patients hospitalized with CAP concluded corticosteroids reduced mortality (RR 0.62 [95% CI 0.45 0.85]) [8, 10 13, 29] and recent guide lines recommend administrating corticosteroids in severe</p><p class="uncategorized">CAP [7].</p><p>In exploratory analysis, it is possible that hydrocorti sone reduced the duration of vasopressor requirement. This finding is consistent with two international tri als of hydrocortisone in septic shock, CORTICUS and ADRENAL, both of which reported no reduction in mortality but faster resolution of shock [30, 31]. Both the anti inflammatory and cardiovascular effects of hydrocortisone could explain the short term ameliorat ing effects on shock. Why an improvement in the resolu tion of shock would not improve longer term outcome is more complicated: patients with severe CAP have mul tiple factors that contribute to their risk of death, and steroids have pleiotropic effects, of which some may ame liorate and others aggravate patients’ risk factors. More</p><p class="uncategorized">though the study was stopped early for slow recruitment</p><p class="uncategorized">broadly, CAP is extremely heterogenous, and the effect</p><hr class="pagebreak" /><p>of steroids may vary across patients, both within this trial and between trials, possibly explaining some of the discrepancies. Furthermore, some of this heterogeneity may be related to features that can be difficult to quan tify accurately, such as the severity of the inflammatory response, degree and nature of underlying comorbidities, causative pathogen, host pathogen interactions, and the time in the course of CAP at which patients present to</p><p class="uncategorized">hospital [32].</p><h3 class="title-2">Limitations</h3><p>This study has important limitations. First, the futility rule that stopped the study may have been premature. It only ruled out a relatively large effect (&gt; 20% relative reduction in mortality), and the sample size was too small to explore subgroup effects. In particular, the lim ited number of patients in the influenza strata preclude any conclusions about the effect of steroids in these patients. Second, the open label design meant clini cians were aware of the treatment assignment, which likely influenced their decision to prescribe corticoster oids in some control arm patients, although typically for a much shorter course. If steroids were beneficial, their use in the control arm would have reduced the effect size, but would be unlikely to cause futility and possible harm. Third, a miscoding error prior to the first adap tive analysis led to erroneous updated response adaptive randomization proportions, which led more patients to be assigned to the fixed duration hydrocortisone inter vention. Though the miscoding may have caused fewer patients to be allocated to receive the optimal treatment, it is unlikely to have changed the overall outcome, as evi denced by the consistent findings across the sensitivity analyses. Fourth, one of the exclusion criteria, chronic corticosteroid therapy was not defined prospectively but</p><p class="uncategorized">by the physician in charge of the patient.</p><h3 class="title-2">Conclusions</h3><p>Among patients with severe CAP, treatment with a 7 day fixed duration course of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, appears unlikely to yield a large reduction in mortality. Smaller benefits and possible</p><p class="uncategorized">harm are not excluded.</p><h3 class="title-2">Supplementary Information</h3><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00134 025 07861 w.</p><h3 class="title-2">Acknowledgements</h3><p>We are grateful to all participating sites, the patients who participated, and their families for their support of this project.
